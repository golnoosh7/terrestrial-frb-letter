The one-off nature of most Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) requires extra scrutiny when
reporting an astrophysical FRB and triggering automated follow-ups with
telescope networks.  In a search for rare signals in a noisy system the number
of false-positive detections is based on the detection threshold and signal
filters. In FRB searches the common approach is to test a series of dispersion
trials, and threshold for peaks above a signal-to-noise threshold.  We present
examples of false-positive events that occur in these searches, which on initial
inspection appear to be FRB-like, but are found to be due to instrumentational
noise and radio frequency interference (RFI). We discuss post-processing
analysis and data which should be provided when reporting a detection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% TODO:
%frb narrative: here are some odd FRB like things, here are some odd reported
%FRBs, it is hard to know if they are real and a ~10% false-positive rate is
%probably fine, but bursts need to be fully reported

The consensus today is that \glspl{frb} are extra-galactic in origin, yet the
emission model is not known. This consensus has been built from the reporting of
detections with multiple telescopes, at different frequencies, using different
instrumentation. The repeater FRB121102 has been localized to a region of dwarf
galaxy using VLBI. Bursts from FRB121102 have been detected up to 8 GHz. Bright
bursts are regularly detected with ASKAP and Molonglo. 

To detect these rare events automated, GPU-accelerated software pipelines are
used to extensively search a broad range of \gls{dm} trials, pulse widths, and
starting times. The de-dispersed time series is then thresholded, any peaks
above a minimum \gls{snr} are reported as potential detections. The number of
potential detections is usually overwhelming due to \gls{rfi} and gain
variations. Initially, potential detections were reviewed by a human. But, with
the wealth of data it has become a significant time effort to do so. Further,
our understanding of the expected detections has allowed the development of
filters and models to select out and prioritize individual events.

We expect a number of false-positives to pass automated post-processing detection
tests, as we would like to severely limit the potential for type-II errors in
our classifier by accepting a number of type-I errors. Once the number of
potential detections has been filters to a reasonable size, they are then
reviewed by a human. This creates a challenge of automating the triggering of
follow-up signalling to other telescopes. Either there will be an excess of
false-positive triggers but with a short delay between detection and triggering.
Or, a non-automated, expert examination of the event is required to verify,
creating a delay in any follow-up.

Besides deciding to do a fast follow-up of a potential FRB source, there is an
challenge of determining how robust the detection is. As these sources are rare
and generally appear not to repeat (all besides FRB121102) there is a issue
of verifiability. There are known anthropogenic sources that appear FRB-like
\citep{2011ApJ...727...18B}. In this paper we present other examples of FRB-like
sources which we show to be terrestrial in origin after further investigation.
When reporting a detection of an astrophysical FRB it is necessary to provide
not just the observational data but additional telescope data to provide a
robust statement about the source origin.

\section{An example of a FRB-like Signal detected with ALFABURST}
\label{sec:D20161204}

In the two years of the initial ALFABURST survey\citep{2017ApJS..228...21C} over
125k 8-second windows have been recorded in which our \gls{frb} search pipeline
detected an event above the minimum \gls{snr} detection threshold. The vast
majority of these events have been due to \gls{rfi}, some of the events are due
to bright single pulses of known pulsars. Most of the events are
clearly \gls{rfi} which are classified with an automated classifier model. A
small number of windows contain FRB-like events which only on further inspection
of the data, the telescope operation status, and contextual information is it
clear that these events are from local sources.

A narrow-in-time, broad-in-frequency, millisecond pulse was detected with the
ALFABURST system at MJD 57726.563263913 / Unix time 1480858266 (09:31:06 Arecibo
local time) in Beam 0 (the central beam) of the \gls{alfa}
receiver\footnote{http://www.naic.edu/alfa/} (Figure
\ref{fig:beam0_dynamic_spec_wide}). ALFABURST was processing 56 MHz of bandwidth
between 1457 MHz and 1513 MHz. The \gls{snr} of this pulse is maximized (10.46)
when the pulse is dedispersed with a \gls{dm} of 293 and the 256 microsecond
resolution is decimated by a factor of 16 to 4 ms time resolution. The
dedispered time series shows an approximately 20 ms \gls{fwhm} pulse. The dip
before and after the pulse is due to the DM-zero removal (i.e. the moving
average is subtracted) during pulse detection. This is a simple way to remove a
drifting gain baseline at the cost of removing some of the overall pulse power,
particularly at low DM. The bright, narrow-band signal at approximately $t=0.1$
seconds is locally generated \gls{rfi} which we will cover later in this
section.

On initial inspection, this event looks like a promising new astrophysical
\gls{frb}. The flux density of the event can be computed with the radiometer
equation
%
$$
S = \textrm{SEFD} \frac{\textrm{SNR}}{\sqrt{D \; \Delta \tau \;
\Delta \nu}}
$$
%
using a \gls{sefd} of 3 Jy for the \gls{alfa} receiver. This results in a flux
density of $S = 66$ mJy from Beam 0, which would be lower flux than any
previously detected \gls{frb} \citep{2016PASA...33...45P}. This flux estimate is
a lower limit, as we are assuming the source was at the centre of the beam. The
width is on the high end for \glspl{frb} but still within the range of those
previously reported.

We inspected all other events in the same time window as the Beam 0 event. An
event was found in Beam 5 only (Figure \ref{fig:beam5_dynamic_spec}). This pulse
lines up exactly in time with the Beam 0 event but the \gls{frb} was maximized
(15.99) with a DM=829 dedispersion. Upon further inspection and testing
different DMs for dedispersion we found that this event appeared to narrow in
width at lower DM trials. We see that there was \gls{rfi} clipping in this event
which is known to introduce a bias, resulting in a maximized \gls{snr} at a
different DM trial. The beam 0 and beam 5 event are the same event.

The beam 5 detection has a lower \gls{snr} than the beam 0 detection at DM trial
293. This is still reasonable as the beam 0 side-lobes overlap with all the other
beams, as does the beam 5 side-lobe overlap with the beam 0 primary beam. This
would indicate that the sky source is somewhere between the beam 0 and beam 5
pointing centres. And, the detection was from the edge of the primary lobe or in
the side-lobe of each beam.

The width of the dedispersed pulse in beam 5 appears wider, but this is likely
due to the lower \gls{snr} of the event having a smaller effect on the
spectrum normalization.

One can look at the immediate period before and after the pulse to see that
there are no similar events (Figure \ref{fig:dm_time}). The event appears to be
isolated in time, with a fairly compact representation in DM-space. The event
would be detected with significant \gls{snr} at higher \gls{dm} trials due to
the wide width of the pulse, but peaks at a \gls{dm} trial of 293.

The Arecibo telescope logging data is reported locally in SCRAM packets which
provide pointing, frequency tuning, and receiver information at approximately
one second resolution. From these logs, the telescope was pointed at a fixed Dec
(+15:11:28.34) and drifting in RA (event detected at RA=14:42:26.18), i.e. a
fixed (alt,az) pointing during the event. No known pulsar or RRAT is within the
beam at this pointing.

We considered that the observing band could have been changed in that time.  We
have setup the automated system to restart observations when the \gls{if}
frequency is changed.  During the time of the event, there was no change in the
\gls{if} during that time.

The SCRAM logs do provide the first indication that this event is due to a local
source. Beyond the pointing and \gls{if}, the SCRAM logs report the position of
the receiver turret and if \gls{alfa} is active. \gls{alfa} is at a position
angle of approximately $26.64^{\circ}$ in the turret, the system reported the
turret was at $206^{\circ}$. \gls{alfa} is not in, or even near the focus.  Our
commensal observation script checks if \gls{alfa} is active before we run
ALFABURST. This is a check on whether the analogue receiver chain is properly
setup for \gls{alfa}, which almost always means that \gls{alfa} is in the focus.
But, as we have found out, there are times when this is not true.

The SCRAM logs do not report the active project or observing schedule. During
the time of the event it appears that no receiver was in use, otherwise,
\gls{alfa} would not have been active, and we see that \gls{alfa} was
deactivated approximately 20 minutes after the event when a new observation
began.  Looking at the observation schedule for the morning of December 4,
project
P3080\footnote{http://www.naic.edu/vscience/schedule/tpfiles/MichillitagP3080tp.pdf}
was using \gls{alfa} to perform an \gls{frb} survey of the Virgo cluster until
09:00 local time.  After 09:00 local time Project
R3037\footnote{http://www.naic.edu/vscience/schedule/tpfiles/TaylortagR3037tp.pdf}
was scheduled, this is an S-Band RADAR observation. 

Looking at the average bandpass of beam 0 and 5 during the time of the event, we
see that the shape and system noise appear different to what is expected during
typical observations (Figure \ref{fig:bandpass_response}).  The detection band
of \gls{alfa} was chosen because it is the most sensitive region of the band,
and relatively flat. But during the event, there is a noticeable shape and slant
to the bandpass which is different than the typical bandpass.  Beam 0 and 5
bandpasses look related in elements of their bandpass shape, and the narrow-band
features due to the short, bright \gls{rfi} events that occur during the
recorded time window. The system noise appears to be higher during the event,
which leads to the bandpasses appearing smoother than the typical bandpass.  In
the detection pipeline the data is normalized, so all absolute scaling is
removed in the process. This indicates that the \gls{sefd} is too low in our
flux calibration. This increase is system noise is due to the change in turret
position, and the \gls{alfa} feed picking up reflections from other equipment in
the dome, and the dome as a warm source.

    reference. These bandpasses have been normalized in the detection pipeline.
    }
    \label{fig:bandpass_response}
\end{figure}

We then looked at previously recorded events close in time to the event.
Approximately 80 seconds earlier another window was recorded which has large
structures across the band (Figure \ref{fig:beam0_dynamic_spec_80s}). Though not
as narrow in time as the event, they appear related to the same phenomenon.

The DM - time plot (Figure \ref{fig:beam0_dmtrials_80s}) shows that much of the
structure would be detected as dispersed pulses.  In particular, the structure
around 4 seconds would be detected as a wide-in-time, highly dispersed pulse.
And the structure immediately proceeding it would be detected as a negative
dispersed pulse.  We do not detect these as pulses because we have limited our
search space to narrow-in-time width pulses and positive \glspl{dm}. Our choice
of search space is reasonable for the type of events we wish to detect given
limited computing resources. But, there are practical advantages to searching
negative \glspl{dm} and wider-in-time pulse widths. We expect astrophysical
pulses to have positive \glspl{dm}. But, system variation and \gls{rfi} can
produce signals which result in positive and negative \gls{dm} detections.  A
statistical measure can be made in any time window to differentiate times of
significant, but low-level \gls{rfi} or system variation from actual
astrophysical pulses. Testing out to larger pulse widths is computationally
cheap as the time window is decimated, reducing the memory usage. A full sampling
of larger pulse widths or negative \gls{dm} trials like the positive \gls{dm}
trials is not necessary. Only a subset can be computed to provide a useful
information on the stability of the system and \gls{rfi} environment.

The narrow-in-frequency, periodic RFI at 1468, 1480, 1496,
1504 MHz is not usually seen in this band. In the high time and frequency
resolution view these short pulses in 12.5 MHz steps have a characteristic
dampened harmonic oscillation due to frequency locking with a \gls{pll} (Figure
\ref{fig:pll_spectrum}). With help from the Arecibo Observatory staff, this has
been identified as instrumentational \gls{rfi} from an instrument that is
routinely used to monitor the local \gls{rfi} environment.

    \label{fig:pll_spectrum}
\end{figure}
%
The exact physical process which generated is additional system noise is not
perfectly well known.  An \gls{rfi} monitoring program was being run on an
instrument not included in the telescope SCRAM data. This instrument introduced
the narrowband \gls{rfi} due to changing of a \gls{lo}.  The \gls{alfa} receiver
was out of the main focus, likely picking up reflections from the dome, leading
to an increase in the system temperature.  This increase caused some part of the
analogue chain, likely an amplifier, to operate beyond it's linear response
region and produce broadband oscillations.  With high certainty, we can classify
this as a local event which created the appearance of an \gls{frb}.  In
isolation, and the one-off, transient nature of FRBs make the initial Beam 0
detection look very reasonable. It is only with an extended study of the
meta-data, earlier-in-time evolution of the band, and use of multiple beams to
confirm that this is indeed not an FRB of astronomical origin.

\section{Low-SNR False-Positive Detections}
\label{sec:low_snr}

As the automated search pipeline is setup to do an extensive search in \gls{dm}
trails, pulse width, and starting time it is reasonable to expect a large number
of low-SNR false-detections.  \gls{frb} surveys tend to have a significant
minimum \gls{snr} cut-off (6-10) due to the large number of false-positive
detections at low \glspl{snr}.  In the ALFABURST and ARTEMIS surveys the minimum
SNR cut-off is set to 10.

Low-SNR detections are regularly detected even with high minimum SNR cut-off.
For example, on July 30, 2015 an apparently 10-sigma event with a DM of 1370 was
detected (Figure \ref{fig:D20150730}). The pulse can barely be seen in the
spectrogram, but in the DM-space plot there is a compact peak centred at a DM of
1370. This event is suspicion because the D20161204 event discussed earlier only
has a slightly higher SNR but is visible in the spectrogram. The solution is
that the actual SNR of this event is approximately 6. The SNR of 10 reported is
based on a longer running average computed in the automated pipeline. Looking
only locally in time there is an increase in system noise, leading to a reduced
SNR. The increase is system noise is because the receiver turret began rotating
in this period while the ALFA receiver was still active.

    telescope metadata it was determined that this event was due to local system
    noise.
    }
    \label{fig:D20150730}
\end{figure}

The reported detection of a pulse from FRB121102 with APERTIF \citep{Atel10693}
was at an SNR around 4. In a blind survey across different sky positions and DM
trials this would not be a significant detection. But, the sky position and
SNR-maximized DM of the repeater is known, thus a lower SNR detection may be
reasonable to report.

\section{Detected RADAR Event with ARTEMIS}
\label{sec:LOFAR_RADAR}

ARTEMIS \citep{2015MNRAS.452.1254K} is a similar to ALFABURST \gls{frb} search
survey run at the LOFAR-UK station at Chilbolton Observatory. The ARTEMIS survey
uses a similar fractional bandwidth ($\sim 0.04$) to the ALFABURST survey, but
centred around 145 MHz. This survey is setup to have known pulsars regularly
transit the fixed in local coordinate beams. Single pulses are routinely
detected. Occasionally, \gls{rfi} events are detected by the automated pipeline. 
A particularly interesting event was detected which had a maximized \gls{snr}
with a \gls{dm} of 85 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lofar_dynamic}. The
narrow-in-time pulse can be seen in the dynamic spectrum at frequencies above
146 MHz, but is not apparent at lower frequencies. As there is significant
narrow band \gls{rfi} below 146 MHz it could be that the pulse is buried. The
dedispered time series shows a strong detection of a pulse of approximately 20
ms in width.

Plotting the event in a DM-space across the ARTEMIS DM range (0-320) (Figure
\ref{fig:lofar_dm_time}) shows a strong, compact detection which we would expect
to see of a dispersed pulse during a time of minimal \gls{rfi}.

%
Since the pulse is only apparent in part of the band we became suspicious of its
origin. It could be that the pulse is broadband but the brightest component is
only seen in the 146-147 MHz region. Or, it could be a band-limited pulse.  The
search pipeline, like ALFABURST and many other search pipelines, decimates the
dynamic spectrum in time to search for over a range of pulse widths. In the case
of the event shown in Figure \ref{fig:lofar_dynamic} the maximized \gls{snr}
occurred with a time decimation factor of 20, the native resolution is $327.68
\mu s$, resulting in a decimated time resolution of 20 ms. By plotting the event
at a higher time resolutions (Figure \ref{fig:lofar_dynamic_high}) we can see
there is a distinct repeating pattern in time not previously apparent. This is a
linearly frequency modulated signal used for pulse compression in RADAR. In
RADAR observations the bandwidth of the transmitter provides information on the
range and direction of a target. A narrow band RADAR transmitter can be used to
approximate a larger bandwidth by modulating the frequency of the transmitted
pulse. There are a number of allocated usages in this band which could be the
source of this RADAR pulse \citep{ofcom2017}.  As the RADAR signal is a
dispersed pulse we would expect to detect such signals with ARTEMIS.

\end{figure}
%
Verification of this event was straight forward by examining the high-time and
frequency resolution data to see the pulsed nature of the event. The frequency
allocation and the use of standard RADAR techniques across the radio band is a
clear indicator of the origin of this event. The challenge comes in the
verification and automated signalling if the desire is to run the system in
real-time with immediate follow-up with additional telescopes. The RADAR event
occurs rarely and there is no obvious detection filter automate. Expert
knowledge in radio signals and visual acuity are necessary to make a decision
about the event. If we are willing to allow an automated VOevent trigger where
we expect a number of false-positives then we can except the rare \gls{rfi}
trigger.

\section{XAO Repeating Event}

The 25-m Nanshan Telescope at \gls{xao} is currently running an FRB survey. The
survey covers over 300 MHz at L-band, sampling at $64 \; \mu s$ resolution. On
November 18, 2016 hundreds of bright, dispersed pulses were detected with the
system. These pulses varied in SNR, but had the same SNR-maximized DM of $531.8
\textrm{cm}^{-3} \textrm{pc}$. The pulses show a distinct double peak ($\sim 2$
ms width) seperated by $\sim 3$ ms (Figure \ref{fig:xao_dynamic}). The pulse is
only apparent in a about a quarter of the band.

    were detected over a period of a few days. The orange bars represent regions
    that have had significant constant-in-time RFI removed.
    }
    \label{fig:xao_dynamic}
\end{figure}

No pointing is reported here as the pulses were seen at different pointings
across the sky. Most were detected at a low altitude pointing angle, but some
were detected with the dish pointed close to zenith.

A periodicity search was run on the observation, a periodicity of $\sim 1.7$ was
found, but the residuals were significantly higher than that of residuals from a
typical pulsar periodicity search. This along with the pointing variability
rules out a pulsar, or an astronomical source in general.

A thorough search of possible local sources, such as new equipment, vehicles,
and aircraft was preformed. No obvious candidate was found. A dispersion
relation parameter estimation found that pulses deviate from a $\nu^{-2}$
relation by $1.5 \sigma$. This can be seen by aligning the pulses, and summing
them together (Figure \ref{fig:xao_summed}). A $\nu^{-2}$ dedispersion with DM
531.8 produces a broadband pulse with an S-shaped structure not seen in the
individual pulses. There is also apparent regular, narrow-band frequency
modulation in the pulse structure. This broad-band structure is due to
non-linearly frequency modulation. This type of modulation is used in chirped
RADAR systems, though it is not as common as linear frequency modulation.

    regions that have had significant constant-in-time RFI removed.
    }
    \label{fig:xao_summed}
\end{figure}

Detection of multiple pulses at different beam pointings indicates the source
may be directly illuminating the feed. The source is likely not due to system
electronics because of the complex frequency modulation. The likely source of
these pulses is a local transmitter. Had only a single pulse been detected with
the telescope, for example if the source was weaker, or the telescope was only
sensitive to the highest SNR event, it would be difficult to show that the event
was due to RFI. Multiple reported \glspl{frb} do not cover the entire observing
band. This has been explained by various astronomical effects (scintillation,
plasma lenses). It would be reasonable to report a single pulse as an \gls{frb}.

The source was only detected over the course of a day, and the origin remains
unknown.  Observations a XAO continue, with an interest is observing in November
2017 to see if the signal returns on an annual schedule.

\section{Previously Reported FRBs}

% FBR170827 data missing from FRBCAT

Given that systematic effects and \gls{rfi} can produce apparent \glspl{frb} it
is useful to look back at previously reported \glspl{frb} that don't fit the
ideal broad-band, single component structure that detection pipelines are
optimized for.

\subsection{FRB130729}

\cite{2016MNRAS.460L..30C} reported detection of FRB130729 along with four other
\glspl{frb} from the HTRU survey. They note that flux only appears in the lower
half of the band, has a double peak structure, and is potentially due to
terrestrial \gls{rfi}.  They report a \gls{dm} of 861 for FRB130729, this
maximizes the detection SNR, but, by using a DM of 852 (Figure
\ref{fig:FRB130729}) the double-peak structure can be seen more evident. BY
using this lower \gls{dm} the pulse width of the two components can be seen to
be much more narrow than the reported $\sim16$ ms.  The two components are
separated by approximately 10 ms, with the second component appearing only about
half as wide in bandwidth compared to the first.

\subsection{FRB140514}

Detection of FRB140514 was reported in \citep{2015MNRAS.447..246P} and was
reported to have significant circular polarization. But, the flux is primarily
concentrated between 1240 MHz and 1270 MHz. This small fractional bandwidth is
not too different from the ARTEMIS event we have reported earlier.  If this
component is removed, for example if the observation was at a slightly different
frequency, or smaller bandwidth, the detected \gls{snr} drops below 10.
Further, many anthropogenic radio transmitters are circularly polarized. But,
it could also be that there is a plasma lensing effect
\citep{2017ApJ...842...35C} which has been used to explain the variable spectral
index and bandwidth of FRB121102, and FRB140514 is indeed astrophysical.

    Gaussian smoothing filter of size 512 $\mu$s, 3.125 MHz.

    \label{fig:FRB140514}
\end{figure}

\subsection{False-Positive Reporting}

During a search for anomalous signals it should be expected that there are a
number of events reported which are false positives. Such as Perytons
\citep{2011ApJ...727...18B} and the events reported in earlier sections. Events
such as FRB130729 and FRB140514 are on the edge of verifiability. They do not
fit the classic \gls{frb} model but given the available observing and system
information, and lack of an external, anthropogenic explanation they are hard
to discount as not being of extra-terrestrial origin. It is necessary to report
all of these events and to provide as much evidence as possible to explain the
origin of such events.

\section{Verification Tests}

The one-off nature of \glspl{frb} makes it essential that when reporting on a
detection or triggering a follow-up observation that significant due-diligence
is done in order to verify a true-positive detection as much as possible. Over the
past decade of \gls{frb} surveys a number of techniques have been developed to
efficiently filter for dispersed pulses. The vast majority of events are flagged
by \gls{rfi} excisers and setting a sufficiently high minimum \gls{snr}
threshold. This has the effect of creating potential false-negative events (i.e.
FRBs classified as RFI), but is not useful with false-positive detections. The
mystery and rarity of FRBs makes it difficult to differentiate astrophysical FRBs
from local sources based on the dynamic spectrum alone. Thus, additional
information on the observing system should be used to provide robustness to the
detection.

% TODO: detection robustness

\subsection{Minimum Reporting}

At a minimum, a reasonable detection should be reported with the observed data
made publicly available.  This allows independent verification, and can be used
as input data sets to test pipeline development.  This is different from other
transient detections in that astronomical pointing and observing frequency is
sufficient to do a follow-up observation. If \glspl{frb} are indeed one-off
event, then the observed data is the only available data. A minimum reporting
should include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Filterbank which fully encompasses the extent of the dispersed pulse.
    \item Time and frequency resolutions, DM, and start time of detection.
    \item Dedispered time series.
    \item Astronomical pointing, observing frequency, and other telescope
    observing parameters.
    \item For a multi-beam system, filterbanks of each beam covering the extent
    of the pulse.
    \item A list (or guide) of software and parameters used to generate
    detections and plots.
\end{enumerate}

These requirements are typically included in past reported \gls{frb} detections.
The last point, a guide on which software was used is often not reported.
Different software and data formats can have slightly different results, such as
the reported \gls{snr} or time definition.  FRBCAT \citep{2016PASA...33...45P}
provides a well-curated repository for this information. 

\subsection{Desirable Reporting}

As has been shown in the previous section there instrumentational and RFI
sources which can produce the apperance of \glspl{frb}. Minimum reporting is
insufficient for these non-astrophysical detections. These detection were only
excluded with additional understanding of the telescope and observing status.
Primarily this would be to expand the reported data in time before and after the
detected event. Desirable reporting would include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Filterbank data which not only encompasses the detected pulse, but
    includes data over a longer time span, e.g. a few minutes before and after
    the detection. If multiple feeds were in use, data from all feeds should be
    made available.
    \item An expected bandpass model, and bandpass model during detection. And,
    the measured gain variation over the observation.
    \item Telescope observing parameters and pointing over the observation,
    including the local (altitude, azimuth) pointing.
    \item A DM-space plot of the detection, along with a negative DM-space
    sampling.
    \item A dispersion fit to the pulse.
\end{enumerate}

Reporting of the bandpass and gain variations, along with a long time data set
allows the state of the telescope to be understood. A deviation from normal
operation, e.g. analogue electronics going into non-linear states, has the
potential to produce spurious events which on a small time-scale can look
FRB-like.

A DM-space plot provides a useful diagnostic to protect against observation
bias. An ideal detection, such as in Figure \ref{fig:dm_time_B1859}, should
appear compact in this space, with no other detections at different trial DMs.

\subsubsection{Negative DM Sampling}

Current surveys typically search out to extreme \glspl{dm}, in the case of
ALFABURST we search out to a \gls{dm} of 10000 as the additional computational
cost is minimum. If the \gls{dm}-redshift relation is approximately correct,
searching to such high \glspl{dm} is sufficient to sample out to the very early
universe. We expect an astrophysical source to be dispersed by a positive
\gls{dm} value. As such we do not search for negatively dispersed pulses. But,
\gls{rfi} does show up as both positive and negative dedispersion detections
(Figure \ref{fig:beamo0_80s}). As the dedispersion search is no longer
computationally limited it would be possible to search the negative \gls{dm}
space. This would be useful as a statistical statement about the number of
positive versus negative detections to quantify the amount of \gls{rfi} during a
detection. The full negative \gls{dm} space would not need to be searched, a
regular sampling of the space would be sufficient.

\subsubsection{Dispersion Fitting}

% TODO: how to do a dispersion fit

\subsection{Future Observational Methods}

Beyond detection of more \glspl{frb}, the goals of current surveys are to
localize the source to host galaxies, and detect pulses across broader
bandwidths across the radio spectrum.

Localization requires the use of interferometric arrays. In the case of a
compact array, a high-time resolution correlation matrix is recorded. And, in
the case of \gls{vlbi} the raw complex voltages are recorded, which can be used
to perform coherent dedispersion resulting in a higher resolution (time and
frequency) dynamic spectrum of the pulses.  Related, multi-site coordinated
observations would remove most, if not all, instrumentational and RFI sources of
false-positive detections.

Pulses from FRB121102 have been detected across a 4 GHz band (4 - 8 GHz)
\citep{atel10675}. Such wide bands show the pulse structure goes beyond the
bandwidth of known source of \gls{rfi} (e.g. modulated RADAR).
Along with the reported detections, the complex voltage data
has been made available.

Detection of \glspl{frb} at multiple frequencies not only adds to the scientific
understanding of the sources, but also help to verify that they are
astrophysical.  Due to historical development of receivers for pulsar searches,
most \glspl{frb} have been detected at L-band frequencies. Though, FRB110523
detected with the GBT and the multiple \glspl{frb} detected with UTMOST occurred
at UHF frequencies.  Only FRB121102 has been detected above L-band.

\section{Conclusion}

\glspl{frb} are unique astronomical sources from an observational point of view
as so far no follow-up observations have been able to verify a source using a
different telescope or observing frequency, except in the case of FRB121102
which is known to repeat. Thus, it is necessary to provide reasonable evidence
for an astrophysical origin when reporting a detection. 

As the size and number of \gls{frb} surveys continues to increase, one expects
an increase in the number of false-positive detections, even as rejection models
are improved. There is a narrow line between true, astrophysical \glspl{frb} and
false-positive events. Ancillary evidence of the telescope state and observation
provide robust evidence for a true-positive detection. 

Though many previously reported \gls{frb} detections have provided sufficient
data and telescope information, more can be provided to present a stronger case
for the astrophysical nature of the detection. Any reported detection at the
minimum should make the observation publicly accessible. Further, as
observing with any radio telescope requires high expert knowledge, it is useful
for the expert observer to include a statement of the telescope status at the
time of a detection.

Current and future surveys which search across large fractional bandwidths, and
localize with interferometric observations will provide further evidence to
associate an \gls{frb} detection with an astrophysical source.

Reporting of false-positive events, even if the source is not explained, helps
to improve the robustness of search pipelines against systematics and \gls{rfi}.
Reporting these events also help improve the case for \glspl{frb} being of
astrophysical origin, just as the explanation for Perytons
\citep{2015MNRAS.451.3933P} removed doubt about detections using Parkes.
